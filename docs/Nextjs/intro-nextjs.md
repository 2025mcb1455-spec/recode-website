Next.js is a powerful React framework for building full-stack web applications. It's built on top of React and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations that make it easier to build production-ready applications. Next.js was created by Vercel (formerly Zeit) and has become one of the most popular React frameworks.

Key Features of Next.js:
Next.js will help you build modern web applications with better performance, SEO, and developer experience.

Next.js offers both <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started">free</a> and commercial hosting solutions through Vercel, with features like automatic deployments, edge functions, and analytics.

## How to start with Next.js?

Whenever you want to build a modern web application with React, you need more than just React itself. You need routing, styling, optimization, and many other features. Next.js provides all these out of the box, making it the perfect solution for building scalable React applications. Some other popular React frameworks are Gatsby, Remix, Create React App, etc. Many of them provide different approaches to building React applications. Currently, Next.js is more popular than other frameworks for building production-ready React applications.

:::info
In the picture below, you can see how Next.js works with different rendering methods. Let's say you're building an e-commerce website; some pages like the homepage can be statically generated at build time, user-specific pages like dashboard can be server-side rendered, and interactive components can be client-side rendered.

So, Next.js gives you the flexibility to choose the right rendering method for each page, optimizing performance and user experience. You can have static pages, server-rendered pages, and client-side rendered components all in the same application.

## What is React??

In the above example, Next.js is built on top of React. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, created by Facebook (now Meta) in 2013. React allows you to build interactive UIs using components, which are reusable pieces of code that manage their own state.

1.  *What is a React Framework?*: To understand React frameworks, let me give you one example; React is like the engine of a car, but to build a complete car, you need wheels, seats, steering, etc. Similarly, to build a complete web application with React, you need routing, styling, data fetching, and many other features. Next.js is like a complete car built around the React engine. It provides all the additional features you need to build production-ready applications.

2.  Basic Next.js Terminology::

        | Keyword | 	Terminology | 	Description |
        | --- | --------------- | -------------------- |
        | SSG   | Static Site Generation | Pre-render pages at build time |
        | SSR  | Server-Side Rendering | 	Render pages on each request |
        | ISR | 	Incremental Static Regeneration| Update static pages without rebuilding the entire site |
        | App Router  | File-based Routing | Automatic routing based on file structure |
        | API Routes  | 	Backend Endpoints | 		Build API endpoints within your Next.js app |
        | Middleware   | 	Request/Response Interceptor | 		Run code before requests are completed |
        | Image Optimization  | 	Automatic Image Processing | 		Optimized images with lazy loading and WebP |
        | Bundle Analyzer  | 	Performance Tool | 		Analyze and optimize your application bundle |
        | Deployment  |  | 		Easy deployment with Vercel or other platforms |
        | Hot Reload  | 	Development Feature | 		Instant updates during development |
        | TypeScript  | 	Built-in Support | 		Full TypeScript support out of the box |

## Why Learn Next.js? 

Next.js simplifies React development and provides many production-ready features out of the box. Next.js is built on top of React and adds powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and automatic code splitting. What we get is better performance, SEO optimization, and developer experience. You can build everything from simple websites to complex full-stack applications.

1.  Basic Next.js Features::

        | Category | 	Description |
        | --- |  -------------------- |
        | Routing | File-based routing system with support for dynamic routes |
        | Rendering | Multiple rendering methods: SSG, SSR, ISR, and Client-side |
        | API Routes | Build backend APIs directly in your Next.js application |
        | Image Optimization | Automatic image optimization with lazy loading |
        | Performance | Automatic code splitting and performance optimizations |
        | SEO | Built-in SEO optimizations and meta tag management |
        | TypeScript | First-class TypeScript support |
        | CSS Support | Built-in support for CSS Modules, Sass, and CSS-in-JS |
        | Deployment | Easy deployment with Vercel and other platforms |

Next.js handles many complex optimizations automatically, so you can focus on building great user experiences rather than configuring build tools and performance optimizations.

### Installation and Setup

To get started with Next.js, you need Node.js installed on your computer. Here's how to create a new Next.js project:

```bash
# Create a new Next.js app
npx create-next-app@latest my-app

# Navigate to your project
cd my-app

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Your Next.js application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Basic Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.js
│   └── page.js
├── public/
├── package.json
└── next.config.js
```
