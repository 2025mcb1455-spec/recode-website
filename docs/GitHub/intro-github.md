## How to start with GitHub?

Whenever you create something exciting or something new on your own, you always want to show it to others. As programmers, we also want to show our projects and codes to others, but how? Many platforms will help you host your code and show it to others, such as Github, Bitbucket, GitLab, Beanstalk, etc. Many of them give you the facility to work on your code together as a team. Currently, Github is more popular than other above-listed platforms for hosting your code.

1.  **What is Git?**: For uploading your project to your Github account, you need to install Git first.  You might remember the relevance of the below picture from the previous posts, In other words, Git helps to do this version management of the files and coordinating work among the diverse team in the software development phase. Git is an open-source project and developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds and Junio.
2.  **What is Version control System?**: To understand the version control system, let me give you one example; sometimes, you wish you have a record that contains all the changes you made in your code or your project. The version control systems are software tools that record all of your changes in the files. It is like a database of changes. Git is a version control system that most developers prefer to use. We will see how you can upload your code on Github using Git.
3.  Basic GitHub Keywords::

        | Category | 	Command | 	Description |
        | --- | --------------- | -------------------- |
        | DQL (Query).  | SELECT | Retrieve data from tables |
        | DML (Manipulation)  | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | 	Modify table records |
        | DDL (Definition)  | 	CREATE, ALTER, DROP | Define or change structure |
        | DCL (Control)  | GRANT, REVOKE | 	Set permissions |
        | TCL (Transactions)  | 	COMMIT, ROLLBACK | 		Manage transactions |



4.  **What Github can do?**: Here want we do is staging the files and doing the commit, You can clone the entire repository and create a branch and commit to that branch ask the main developer to merge the branch. when you clone in reality you are creating a copy of the real code/repository in your local environment.

The fork is a personal copy of the repo which is already present or uploaded in GitHub by a different user. Once you fork and make changes to the repository the changes will happen to your forked repo, not the real one.
